# Archer2 Trilinos installation

## Trilinos tests

## Build

## Modules

The module only address `CC` at the moment. 

## Installation test

An installation test is cobbled together from the (very) simple example
appearing in `demos/BuildAgainstTrilinos/`. The (corrected) source
files are compiled and run against dummy inputs. This is run
in the queue system along as part of `build-trilinos.sh`.
